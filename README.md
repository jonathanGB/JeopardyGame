# Jeopardy Game

Java Project done for "Introduction to Programming II"
Author: Jonathan Guillotte-Blouin

This was compiling using the command-line.
The JavaDoc has not been included, but can be generated in the terminal using "javadoc -d doc *.java" when in the same directory as the project.
This implementation checks for a valid file format for the Database.
It also handles creating a grid directly from the command-line, using the relative path to the file as an argument, rather than having to input it through the "Load" dialog box.
e.g. java Jeopardy questions/actualJeopardyQuestions.txt

The questions .txt files are in the "questions" directory
